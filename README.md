# Password Generator

This project is intended to produce a random password generator based on user-selected criteria. The application validates user input and ensures the generated password contains between 8 and 128 characters, and is made up of at least one character type. Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a randomly generatd password as a result of the user's response. The user will have the option to copy the generated password to the clipboard by clicking the COPY button.
